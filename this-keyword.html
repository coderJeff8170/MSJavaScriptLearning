        //takeaway here is that whenever code is called from an inline onclick event handler,
        //`this` is set the the DOM element on which that element was defined!(here, the
        //`this` in clickHandler's paremeters)
        //The second `this` on the last line in the code block refers to the Window object,
        //it's not confined to that button, it's on the global scale, like the function - 
        //we've not taken any steps to bind it to anything so it defaults to the global object.
        //the takeaway here is that what `this` is bound to is not always obvious
        //and takes some detective work. How a function is called, and where it is called from.
